        <p>Happy fathers day pap! You are the best dad a son could ever ask for. I didn't realize this before but you care, a lot. We went to the park every day to train when I didn't want to, but now I understand why. You've helped me get where I am today, so very much thank you. And not only that. You have done so many other things, like taking Erik from me when I'm tired and buying those uniforms every two years that cost $500. I can't wait to train with you again. Love you pap and happy Fathers Day!</p>
